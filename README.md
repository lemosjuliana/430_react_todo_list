# To-do List

## Intro

This is an introductory school project for a Full-Stack development class at Brigham Young University. This project aimed to familiarize myself with the basics of React and JSX. 

## The To-do List Project

The project consists of a to-do list based on a video tutorial by the Web Dev Simplified channel, and customized by me to fit the class's needs.
